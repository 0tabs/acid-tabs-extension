- Setting
    - Auto layout on / off
    - Allow empty names on / off
    - Allow commas as separators (cannot use in patterns when on)

- Tooltip for pattern info?
- bidirectional changes (changing label on actual tab group persist)


BUG
- One invalid causes no save (maybe just a better indicator that something is invalid and no saving)


NICE
- Make regex vs normal pattern a global option
- If regex on, show pattern as valid or not
- include current tabs in window on default view
- default view with edit toggle
- Drag rules for order
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Autocollapse groups after not used for x amount of time
- Hold command, put the starting number of tab in each group name

- Suggest domains based on current tabs open

    
- Could inject into page for interface (take up full width and right under address bar)
- Left align groups
- Tooltips?
- Advanced toggle?
- Decide on seed rules
    - Email
    - Social
    - News
    - Shopping
